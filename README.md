# first-pygame-tutorial
This is a basic tutorial from https://realpython.com/pygame-a-primer/
I did not complete this upon first trial because I could not download the image assets, and the ones I found were too large to use. It was also getting late.
I may complete it in the future, but hopefully this serves as a good jumping off point for the future. I would like to create some games in the future, gotta start somewhere.
